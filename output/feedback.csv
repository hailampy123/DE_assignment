To get there, you have to walk through the ""garage""/ground floor, up a flight of stairs in the back and you will see it on your left about 15m after you hit the first floor.

The ordering was explained to me very well and was easily done (think Chipotle but poke). I ordered sushi rice with tofu and 2x spicy salmon and many fresh toppings. Excellent tasting, fresh, cool air and atmosphere.",en,2022-11-17,google

chris an,3,"Some sanitary issues:

1) putting spoon on top of charity box. Money is very dirty and no napkins or barrier placed between spoon and the slot where people put money was a little surprising!

2) The food specifically cream was touching the side of the counter. Even if the serving counter is clean nobody wants there food to be touching any part of the counter!

3) 2 workers were smoking. So the smoke went to me and I was smelling and inhaling  2nd hand smoke while the wind blew it towards my direction.

Food is good but portions are quite small for the price. I eat poke bowls quite often in my home country and the price is similar but the portions here are not filling.",en,2023-03-17,google
Kaylyn Goh,5,"I bought a regular poke bowl for 180k VND, which gives 2 scoops of proteins and unlimited toppings. While the food might be pricey compared to other food options you can find, the poke bowl was worth it! Fresh ingredients with a whole lot of toppings, which made the poke bowl much more yummy. My only gripe would be the relatively small portion of salmon/ shrimps given for proteins.

Also a small note that the restaurant is located on the higher floors, so you'd have to walk through a bike shop and up a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant",en,2022-10-18,google

Helpful tip: it‚Äôs on the second floor and it doesn‚Äôt have a large sign on the first floor. You‚Äôll see two rows of motorbikes with a pathway to stairs going up.

You pick whether you want salad, rice or brown rice or mix for a base. You pick 2 seafood, and any mix of other fresh ingredients you want, and sauces to top it off. The flavors were a delight and everything was so fresh. It was incredible. For me I chose a mix salad and rice with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, cucumber, edamame, hot peppers, seaweed, pomegranate, dried seaweed, ginger and topped with spicy sauce and sesame. It was so incredible. My wife selected among less spicy ingredients and loved hers as well. The bowl were more than enough to fulfill a hearty appetite, but you would be hard pressed to leave anything uneaten as the flavors are so good. The 2 bowls along with a buy one get one beer special and a sprite came to 425K VND (about $18.40). We were stuffed and happy when we left.

James Concepcion,5,"This is a hidden gem in the city. Located on the second floor of a residential building that you need to access via a garage with 40 motorbikes and a tiny stairway. This is probably the best Poke I have had.

You start the same way as most places by stating your base. I and my buddy picked 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 greens. I then picked my protein as octopus and shrimp while my buddy did double salmon.

We then got to salad bar section and we were blown away. This was like a Subway on double steroids as seen in my pictures. There was quail eggs, Japanese radish, guacamole, corn, pineapple, mushrooms, olives, edamame, Kani crab flakes, shisho leaves, sesame seeds, Nori flakes aside from the standard green, purple and curly lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, spinach, bell peppers and various hot peppers.

I had all the toppings on mine and my bowl weighed in at over a pound. My buddy was a bit reserved and only had standard salad fare with guacamole.

Did I also tell you that after I finished the Poke server asked if I wanted a free refill of the salad toppings. Now I see why this restaurant has a non-stop delivery business and is rated #5 of all restaurants in Saigon on Trip Advisor.",en,2020-04-16,google

Then just walk up a floor & you'll be outside again, you will see signs for the restaurant along the way. It's kind of hot in the daytime, & super packed for lunch so keep that in mind. ;) But if you manage to get here on a cool, off-lunch time, you'll be taken on a healthy food bowl journey that you get to customize. For the price it's a massive variety, but still pricey in my opinion, a little under 10$ without guac.
